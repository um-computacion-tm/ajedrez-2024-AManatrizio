CHANGELOG

---- September 30, 2024 ----
- Code Smell Fixes: Refined the is_valid_move function to address code smell issues.
- Code Refactoring: The is_valid_move function was split into smaller functions to
- improve clarity and maintainability:
are_positions_valid: Verifies if the start and end positions are valid and within the board limits.
is_piece_movement_valid: Checks if the piece's movement is valid according to its rules.
is_destination_valid: Ensures the target cell doesn't contain a piece of the same color.
get_movement_type: Determines if the movement is horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
- Improved Structure: The refactoring simplifies the code and enhances readability.


---- September 29, 2024 ----
- Bug Fixes and Improvements: Made several adjustments to resolve errors and enhance 
the overall functionality.
- Game Over Logic: I'm thinking about how to implement the is_over function, which will 
determine how the game ends. I already have variables to track the captures of each piece
and to determine if either king has been captured. I still need to write the code for this
functionality.

---- September 27, 2024 ----
- Path Checking in Movement: Incorporated the is_path_clear method inside is_valid_move
to prevent pieces, except the knight, from jumping over others.

---- September 26, 2024 ----
- Capture Functionality: Added the get_captures method to Chess for tracking captured pieces 
and integrated it into the main class.

---- September 24, 2024 ----
- King and Pawn Improvements: Enhanced the logic for the movement of the King and Pawn classes.
- Pieces: The specific movements that each piece can and cannot make are now clearly defined and working.
I've been playing the game, and it works quite well overall. However, there are some issues,
such as pieces jumping over others.

---- September 23, 2024 ----
- Refactoring: Cleaned up the Pawn class and restructured test_board for better readability 
and performance.
- Captures: Introduced a function to track the number of black and white pieces captured during
the game.

---- September 22, 2024 ----
- Queen Logic Update: Made changes to the Queen's movement method and its corresponding tests.
- Pawn Movement Validation: Added is_valid_movement to the Pawn class to ensure correct validation
for forward and diagonal moves.
Improved Structure: The refactoring simplifies the code and enhances readability.
- Capture Logic: Currently considering how to define piece captures and keep track of the
number of pieces captured for each color. This feature is still under development, and
further thought is needed to determine the best implementation.

---- September 20, 2024 ----
- Bishop Movement Update: Adjusted the movement validation logic for the Bishop to correct errors.
- Knight Movement: Modified the is_valid_movement method for the Knight and updated the tests accordingly.

---- September 16, 2024 ----
- Testing Enhancements: Refactored tests for the Board class and added tests for Chess and Bishop.
Also cleaned up duplication issues in the tests.

---- September 13, 2024 ----
- Rook Movement: Finalized the is_valid_movement logic for the Rook and made related changes to
the Chess and Main classes.

---- September 11, 2024 ----
King Movement Validation: Added is_valid_movement to the King class, incorporating the correct 
movement rules for the King, and added unit tests.

---- September 8, 2024 ----
- Board and Chess Methods: Added the is_valid_move and move_piece methods to Board, and the 
play_move and parse_move methods to Chess.

---- September 7, 2024 ----
- Path Clearing Functionality: Introduced the is_path_clear method in Board to ensure valid
movement paths and added related tests.

---- September 6, 2024 ----
- Turn and Move Logic: Added switch_turn and play_move to Chess and resolved issues with the 
Rook tests.

---- September 3, 2024 ----
- Rook Class Update: Updated the Rook class to use the Board instance for move validation 
and path checking. Also updated the README.

---- August 30, 2024 ----
- Piece Representation: Improved the visual representation of the chess pieces and made
changes to the changelog for better clarity.
